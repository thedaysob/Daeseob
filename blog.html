<h1>June 5th, 2019</h1>
<p>My job as an intern at Topon begins next Monday. I have been taking a little easy with coding and learning. However, I have been doing a little bit of prep for the internship. I have been re-familiarizing myself with basic c++ and javascript. Aside from my job, I have been watching MIT open course ware 006 Introduction to Algorithm. Also yesterday, I thought of this idea where where people can organize pick up basketball or soccer games by dropping a pin on google maps. I think I can implement this with google maps api, but I haven't really thought of how the client will interact with the server. I have also been reading a book called <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-numbers-game-michael-blastland/1014353049?ean=9781440655289&st=PLA&sid=BNB_ADL+EBooks+Good+Desktop+Low&sourceId=PLAGoNA&dpid=tdtve346c&2sid=Google_c&gclid=CjwKCAjw0N3nBRBvEiwAHMwvNrvmhD4UPhLFjifpPqCBbQ7ODwcHvdgM5ub43YtsrTEnO81zvu_LgxoCHGMQAvD_BwE">The Numbers Game</a>. It is a short read, but a good one.</p> 
<h1>May 31th, 2019</h1>
<p>Good read <a href="http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=131034&seqNum=5">TCP/IP</a></p>
<h1>May 28th, 2019</h1>
<p>I've rencently done a lot of researching and reading on networks and protocols. I have been looking at CMU network and protocol class 15-441. <a href="https://computer-networks.github.io/sp19/lectures.html">CMU Network lectures</a>. So far I have learned a lot about LANs, structure of networks, and router algorithms. I hope to understand this topic in deep detail and maybe start develop something with it.</p>
<h1>May 23rd, 2019</h1>
<p>I'm in search for a new project. I have refined and polished the NBA website with bootstrap. I was reading up on different methods of machine learning such as linear regression, closest neighbor and such. But I believe I do not want to work on ML this summer as I'll be taking a class on it next semester... I thought of going deeper into web development which involves learning php, react, angular and such. It seems as though these technology listed are very popular in the industry. I need to give it more thought.</p>
<h1>May 20th, 2019</h1>
<p>Have a working nba scoreboard. But it is troubled by the number of requests it can make to the api endpoint. I have used up the max number of requests for today. I think I need to make the request less frequent. <a href="https://live-nba-scores.herokuapp.com/">NBA Games</a></p>
<h1>May 18th, 2019</h1>
<p>Must read for creating a live score board. <a href ="https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/real-time-sports-application-using-nodejs--cms-30594">How to create a scoreboard</a>. I must use socket.io. Having worked with websockets, I am not too worried figuring out how to use socket.io. I'll be going up to Boston to see some seniors graduate so I will not be able to code the next two days.</p>
<h1>May 16th, 2019</h1>
<p>I messed around with the NBA api. I am rusty on both Node.js (asynchronous) and XMLHttpRequest. But I managed to get to the NBA API endpoint and display it when get method was used to the server. Still need a lot more work on web development.</p> 
<h1>May 15th, 2019</h1>
<p>Scrap the reddit idea. I think I will try to develop a website for NBA relevant topics. Here is the documentation for the API <a href="https://github.com/kshvmdn/nba.js/blob/master/docs/api/DATA.md"> NBA API</a>
<h1>May 14th, 2019</h1>
<p>I have almost completed the websocket chat application. Thinking about the future, I think I want to use reddit's API to duplicate the front page of reddit.</p>
<h1>May 13th, 2019</h1>
<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28516962/how-websocket-server-handles-multiple-incoming-connection-requests">Websocket</a>Great read for understanding websocket. I'm sure I'll return to it at some point.</p>
<h1>May 12th, 2019</h1>
<p>On this day, I fixed and launched my new personal website. Tomorrow, I plan to work on my web messaging application.</p>
